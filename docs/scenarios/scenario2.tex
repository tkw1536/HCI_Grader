\subsection{Scenario 2 - TA Grading}

Our TA, Filip Nikolche, wants to grade assignments for a course he is TAing.
He signs into jGrader and selects the course (Python) from the list of courses on the landing page. He then selects assignment 3 because it is not fully graded, and he begins working on it. He downloads the submissions, reads them in the text editor of his choice on his computer, and he enters his grades and comments into the page. At the end of his grading session, he updates all grade slots to ensure that the grades are saved, and he signs out.
