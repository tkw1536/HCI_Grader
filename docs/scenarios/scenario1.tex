\subsection{Scenario 1 - Homework submission}

Alice wants to submit a homework for her Python course.
She opens the jGrader homepage and sees that it is due very soon, this week

On the same page a ``Upload files'' field appears. Alice finds the file on her computer and drags it into the field that just appeared. Because the file is very big (it contains a lot of scanned images) jGrader shows a progress bar while the file is uploaded. After a few seconds, the upload finishes and Alice gets a confirmation that the file was indeed uploaded. She then close the page.
