From there she realizes that the next assignment due is for Python Lab. Alice clicks on the \textit{Current courses} to have an overview of all her courses.\\

Since she still has to do her Python homework assignment she navigates to the Python Lab.\\
The course page layout is designed to provide an easy to use and comprehensive dashboard for each course. It contains current assignments, previous assignments, tools to view further information, request extensions \& excuses, and an overview of the course grading breakdown, instructors, credits, and other important information.\\

On the top of the page Alice can choose the current homework screen or the previous homework Assignments screen. On the current homework screen the most frequently accessed elements are at the top of the screen to minimize scrolling and allow for easy accessibility. Hence the first information is when the deadline for the current assignment it and right below it is a huge submit button that cannot be missed. Apart from this it also has buttons to view the current assignment, to request and extension, and to request an excuse. The colors for the buttons are green, yellow, and red respectively which underlines how crucial the respective action is. E.g. requesting an excuse is a more crucial action than requesting an extension.\\

Below the buttons that allow Alice to perform actions, the course page offers information about the course and the grading criteria. Being naturally curious about the grades she received on previous homework assignments, she goes to that section and can see her previous submissions and the grades she received for them in a nicely formatted table.\\
