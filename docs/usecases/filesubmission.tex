\subsection{File Submission}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Agents:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Student
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Purpose:} Grading platforms should be capable of collecting assignment submissions, timestamped and stored in a central location
  \item \textbf{Procedure:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Student visits authenticated landing page, which shows outstanding assignments for courses
    \item Clicking on the assignment goes to the assignment page, containing the project spec, an accessor for the most recent previously submitted file (if applicable), and a submission interface
    \item If a small number of files is to be submitted, simply dragging and dropping/upload dialog for each slot will work
    \item If a larger/unknown number of files is to be submitted, uploading a zip file will happen instead. If enabled, jGrader will unzip it and attempt to match the contents to any file-specific slots that may exist.
    \item After uploading, the file submission slot will turn grey and show a confirmation message until the page is refreshed. (After refreshing, the previously submitted accessor will be shown)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
