\subsection{Grading}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Agents:} \begin{enumerate}
    \item Student(s)
    \item Teaching Assistant/Instructor
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Purpose:} A student has submitted assignments, and the grades for the work must be entered into the gradebook.
  \item \textbf{Procedure:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Teaching Assistant logs into jGrader and selects the course they are grading for from a list
    \item The TA selects the assignment/task submission to be graded
    \item After loading the page, the TA either downloads all submissions, or they download an individual's submission by clicking the down arrow next to the person's name
    \item The TA opens each submission and grades it accordingly on their local system outside of jGrader
    \item The TA enters their feedback into the feedback field, and the grade into the grade field, and clicks update.
    	\subitem Alternately, they can skip the updating and just update all at once by clicking "Update All"
    \item The grading dashboard now shows the current grading status for the assignment, which is hopefully 100\% graded. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
