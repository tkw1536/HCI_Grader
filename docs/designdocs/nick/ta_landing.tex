\subsection{TA Landing Page (Nick)}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{screenshots/TALandingPage.png}
The TA landing page is mostly the same as the student menu, and contains no major differentiation in the prototype beyond easy links to the grading pages for current courses. In a production environment, the current and previous courses would show any courses for which they have TA permissions. 

When the TA enters the grading overview page, they see a list of assignments for that course, along with the current status of the grading for the assignment. Colour coding helps the user to quickly navigate an information-dense page. Aqua indicates that grading is complete and there is no further action required. Yellow indicates that grading is partly finished, and orange indicates that grading has not started. Grey is used to indicate a non-actionable assignment that has received no submissions yet.
