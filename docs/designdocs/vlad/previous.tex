The current courses page features a sparse, left-justified layout in order to simplify the task of getting to the course page the user needs--minimal information beyond a grade overview, large \& attention-catching course icons, and the page navigation buttons is included. Following the rule-of-thirds by left-justifying the content helps the user process the information quicker.
