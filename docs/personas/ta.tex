\subsection{The TA: Filip Nikolche}

He studies Computer Science at Jacobs University. He transferred from University of Hamburg after his first year. He is now in his 3rd year and is writing his thesis with the Computer Networks research group.
Because he wants to focus on his thesis, he decided not to take any courses this semester. His thesis topic subject is ``Large Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance''. However he wants to earn some extra money, so he is TAing 3 courses via jGrader, Python Lab, C Lab and Calculus I.

He was an intern at Microsoft last summer. His hobbies are reading SF books and tech articles.
