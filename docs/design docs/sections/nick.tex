TA Grading Page:

\begin{itemize}
\item Assignments, sorted in descending order by `'\% ungraded'`', followed by `'most distant due date in the past'`' are selected from a main TA dashboard for the course showing numbers of graded tasks, a list of students, and other information.

\item `'We placed the comment box before the grade box in order to encourage TAs to provide comments for grades; when tabbing through the page, the comment field will be selected first'`

\item Ample space is provided between assignment entries in order to reduce the chance of visual confusion. In a complete implementation, JavaScript would also be used to turn the currently selected row/row fields are in grey in order to further differentiate what's being edited.

\item A single submit grades button, which floats throughout the page for easy access, reduces the number of steps necessary to enter a grade, which is important for TAs when grading large numbers of small assignments.

\item Different sizes between the comment and grade fields provide further visual differentiation.
\end{itemize}
